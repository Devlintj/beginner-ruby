# how to use RUBY

## variables
_variables are an **important** part of coding **especially** in RUBY._
### assigning values
you can **assign** values by setting your variable **equal** to something. for example:
```
variable = 5
```
will assign the value of 5 to your "variable" variable.
### Uses with values being assigned to variables
you can use this to **store** a value and **change it** for example:
```
variable * 5
```
will take whatever is **stored** in your **"variable"** variable and **multiply it by 5.**
### types of variables
there are several **types** of variables. the most common are **strings**, **floats**, and **integers**
#### integers
**integers are any whole numbers** like in the examples I've shown. by it **5** , **10** , or **-2** these are all integers
#### floats
**floats are similar to integers** except they have a **decimal point**
```
5.2 = a float
```
