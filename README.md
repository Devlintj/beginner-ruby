# how to use RUBY

## variables
_variables are an **important** part of coding **especially** in RUBY._
### assigning values
you can **assign** values by setting your variable **equal** to something. for example:
```
variable = 5
```
will assign the value of 5 to your "variable" variable.
### Uses with values being assigned to variables
you can use this to **store** a value and **change it** for example:
```
variable * 5
```
will take whatever is **stored** in your **"variable"** variable and **multiply it by 5.**
### types of variables
there are several **types** of variables. the most common are **strings**, **floats**, and **integers**
#### integers
**integers are any whole numbers** like in the examples I've shown. by it **5** , **10** , or **-2** these are all integers
```
5 = a integer
```
#### floats
**floats are similar to integers** except they have a **decimal point**
```
5.2 = a float
```
#### strings
strings are any **string of charracters** which can be **words**, **letters**, or **symbols**
```
"string" == a string
```
## Conditionals
with code, conditionals are **crutial** in executing certain methods. There are two main types, **expressions** and **branching**
### expressions
expressions are **symbols that respresent words**. they are:
* or means ||
* exclusive or(xor) means ^
* and means &&
* ! means not
### branching
branching is when a code **can take more than one path** for example:
```
if a happens
    do magic
    elsif b happens
    no more magic
end
```
## methods
methods are **blocks of code** that you can run by calling the **method name** with a variable. for example:
```
def my_madness(puns)
    print "there's #{puns}} to my madness"
end
```
